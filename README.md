2. **The Mobile Application**

The mobile app will adhere to the key values that LEprovides to its clients, placing the needs of the user at the forefront of all work. The mobile app will present 8 pages that willbe highly responsive inspiring a sense of trust in the users. Utilizing particular colour palettes, typefaces, images, appealing textures, and great aesthetics, the app will captivate users to stay longer on the mobile app, fostering a good connection and relationship with LEclients.

Structure and Architecture

The new website willpresent 8 pages, distributed on main pages like:

- 1 Landing Page;
- 2 Tours Pages;
- 2 Touristic Guides Pages;
- 2 Payment Pages;
- 1 Confirmation Page.

The web page willbe capable of delivering 3 main tasks for its users like:

- Search for tours routes.
- Search for touristic professional guides.
- Login page.
1. **Targeted<a name="_page5_x72.00_y173.66"></a> Audience**

LE's target audience comprises a diverse range of foreign tourists, that share a keen interest in London's historical sites and facts, seeking immersive experiences that delve into the city's rich cultural heritage, spanning from 15 to 70+ years of age, embracing both small and large groups.

2. **Features<a name="_page5_x72.00_y321.28"></a> of the Mobile app** Features and Functionality
- Intuitive Navigation –The navigation menu will be easy to understand and use, enabling a smooth transition from selecting tours to choosing guides, and finalising bookings.
- Tour Selection –By choosing preferred categories, such as history, art, food, or theatre, users get a personalised experience while using the app.
- Guide Selection – Users will be able to select from a list of tour guides tailored to their specific needs.
- Quick Loading Time – The application is optimised for high performance, ensuring quick loading times for all its features.
- Visual Content – To provide a more engaging and immersive experience, the application incorporates high-quality visuals.
- ***Secure Payment Gateway –This feature allows users to make online payments for their chosen tours safely and conveniently, supporting various payment methods like credit/debit cards.***
3. **Palette<a name="_page5_x72.00_y705.74"></a> Colour**

The palette colours used on the LE mobile app must correspond to the right feeling and psychological impact that draw visitors to London. The colour impact will encourage an immersive experience in order to be consistent with the company's proposition. The proper color mixing is also necessary to avoid eye fatigue and provide adequate color contrast. Meeting all of these specifications, the app will deliver to users the impression that they want to travel to the destination right away (Kondratova and Goldfarb, 2007).

The two primary color schemes used in the app will complement one another. This colour method is called Complementary and it is considered the simplest scheme color effect. The goal of this strategy is to catch the user's attention at its best.

The app is directly related to London city in England and British flag colors will be used as the basis palette color for the app. For this reason, the website willdisplay a small amount of red that stands out when presented with an object that is predominantly blue or white.

<a name="_page6_x72.00_y322.44"></a>**3.1 Palette color information:**

![](Aspose.Words.63fb15a5-0358-4c11-afd0-f6a91e5832e1.005.png)

4. **Font<a name="_page7_x72.00_y326.30"></a> Size and Style**

LE mobile app will use the Catamaran font type. This font is thought to convey a classy yet laid-back vibe and may be utilized for a range of tasks because to its versatility.

**Iam Catamaran Font.**

Because Iam a versatile font style!

5. **Images**

<a name="_page7_x72.00_y571.94"></a>“As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Images can be a powerful way to capture users’ attention and differentiate your product. They are more than decoration and have the power to make or break a user experience.”Icons8 (2023)

![](Aspose.Words.63fb15a5-0358-4c11-afd0-f6a91e5832e1.006.png)

Images hold paramount importance on webpages, and given the nature of LE's tourism industry, each image featured on the mobile app must be directly associated with London's touristic places. These images will display iconic landmarks, cultural ambience, intriguing facts of the city, effectively capturing the essence of London's vibrant tourism scene.

6. **Navigation**

<a name="_page8_x72.00_y536.57"></a>LE mobile app will provide users with a seamless and intuitive navigation experience. Through visually clear presentation, the app's main concepts and structure willadhere to five fundamental elements:

- Differentiating navigation from page elements using color and white space.
- Hamburger dropdown menu detailing structure of LEapp.
- Basic vocabulary.
- Responsive menus.
- Uses of flatten structure.
7. **Technology<a name="_page8_x72.00_y756.20"></a> Stack**

We will employ mobile android Java language approaches to shape the design and style of the app in order to produce a responsive application, bringing LE ideals to life improving user experience.

8. **Lowand<a name="_page9_x72.00_y339.16"></a> High Fidelity**

*“Wireframes are one of the simplest tools you can use to convey a big idea. But the value of a wireframe goes much further than simply getting your idea down on paper or[down in Figma.”](https://www.figma.com/wireframe-tool/)Figma (2019)*

We use Fidelity designs as the initial version of a future mobile app to evaluate design concepts and ideas. When designing prototypes, the great variety of mobile phones and tablets now available on the market was taken into account. Using Java language allowed us to easily fit all of the mobile phones screen sizes using the same code.

Low fidelity display initial design that will be applied to LEapp project and this will enable us to comprehend the possible outcomes of the initial project prototype. High Fidelity is the following designing practice that includes all of the details and functionality related to the final prototypes as displayed below:
